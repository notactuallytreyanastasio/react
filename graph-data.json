We tried exploring various options of running in Web Workers, parallel JS, tried to propose shared immutable persistent data structures to the language, experimented with custom VM tweaks etc. JavaScript the language isn't very suitable for this because of mutable shared runtimes like prototypes. The ecosystem isn't ready for it because you have to duplicate code loading and module initialization across workers. Garbage collectors are not as efficient as they currently are if they have to be thread safe, and VM implementors seem to be unwilling to bare the implementation cost of persistent data structures. Shared mutable typed arrays seems to be moving along but requiring all data to go through this layer seems to be unfeasible in the ecosystem today. Artificial boundaries between different parts of the code base also doesn't work very well and introduces unnecessary friction. Even then you have lots of JS code like utility libraries that have to be duplicated across workers. Which leads to slower start up time and memory overhead. So, yes, threads are likely out of the question until we can target something like Web Assembly.\\n>\\n> **However**, an interesting realization is that there are _other_ benefits of the Fiber architecture that are applicable whether you have threads or not.\\n>\\n> You can't safely abort the background thread. Aborting and restarting a thread is not very cheap. In many languages it is also not safe because you could be in the middle of some lazy initialization work. Even though it is effectively interrupted, you have to continue spending CPU cycles on it.\\\"\\n\\n### Key Reasons for Rejection\\n1. JS lacks good thread support due to mutable shared runtimes\\n2. Code duplication across workers (slower startup, memory overhead)\\n3. Can't safely abort a thread mid-work\\n4. Can't share memoized work between threads\\n5. Even with threads, still need yield points for safe abortion\\n\\n### Interesting Insight\\nSebastian noted that even ComponentKit (native iOS) which HAS threads still needs cooperative scheduling - threads alone don't solve the problem.\"}"

You have to wrap every single function in a generator. This not only adds a lot of syntactic overhead but also runtime overhead in any existing implementation. It's fair that the syntax might be more helpful than not, but the perf issue still stands.\\n>\\n> 2) The biggest reason, however, is that generators are stateful.

However, if I get an update to B when I have already completed `doExpensiveWorkA(a)` _and_ `doExpensiveWorkB(b)` but not `doExpensiveWorkC(c)` there is no way for me to reuse the value `x`. I.e. to skip ahead to `doExpensiveWorkB` with a different value for `b` but still reuse the result of `doExpensiveWorkA(a)`.\\n>\\n> This is important to React since we do a lot of memoization.\\\"\\n\\n### Key Reasons for Rejection\\n1. **Syntactic overhead**: Every function must be wrapped as a generator\\n2. **Runtime overhead**: Performance cost in existing JS implementations  \\n3. **Stateful nature**: Can't resume from arbitrary points\\n4. **Memoization incompatible**: Can't skip ahead while reusing earlier work\\n5. React's memoization strategy requires ability to partially reuse work\\n\\n### The Memoization Problem Explained\\nReact needs to be able to say \\\"props for component A didn't change, skip re-rendering A but continue with B\\\". Generators can't do this - they're linear state machines.\"}"

Two-Phase Rendering (No Side Effects During Work)\\n> \\\"You may mutate the fiber that you're working on during `beginWork` and `completeWork` phases but you may not have any other global side-effects. If you need a global side-effect, that have to be moved to the `commitWork` phase.\\\"\\n\\n#### 2. Fixed Data Structure (Performance)\\n> \\\"Fiber is a fixed data structure. It shares the same hidden class. Never add fields outside of construction in `ReactFiber`.\\\"\\n\\n#### 3. No Dynamic Dispatch (Optimization)\\n> \\\"Nothing in the reconciler uses dynamic dispatch. I.e. we don't call a first class function, except for user code such as ref callbacks, functional components, render methods, etc. The rest is a static function available in a closure. I.e. use `myHelper(obj)` instead of `obj.myHelper()`. Any time we need to branch logic we use a switch statement over a `tag` which is a number.\\\"\\n\\n#### 4. No JS Stack Recursion (Enables Yielding)\\n> \\\"Nothing in Fiber uses the normal JS stack. Meaning it does use the stack but it can be compiled into a flat function if needed. Calling other functions is fine - the only limitation is that they can't be recursive.\\\"\\n\\n#### 5. Singly-Linked List Traversal Algorithm\\n> \\\"If I can't use recursion, how do I traverse through the tree? Learn to use the singly linked list tree traversal algorithm.\\\"\\n\\n```js\\nlet root = fiber;\\nlet node = fiber;\\nwhile (true) {\\n  // Do something with node\\n  if (node.child) {\\n    node = node.child;\\n    continue;\\n  }\\n  if (node === root) {\\n    return;\\n  }\\n  while (!node.sibling) {\\n    if (!node.return || node.return === root) {\\n      return;\\n    }\\n    node = node.return;\\n  }\\n  node = node.sibling;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Why This Design Wins\\n\\n> \\\"We can use the normal JS stack for this but any time we yield in a `requestIdleCallback` we would have to rebuild the stack when we continue. Since this only lasts for about 50ms when idle, we would spend some time unwinding and rebuilding the stack each time.\\\"\\n\\n> \\\"Most of what React does is in the space of what the normal stack does. E.g. memoization, error handling, etc. Using the normal stack too, just makes it more difficult to get those to interact.\\\"\\n\\n> \\\"Everything we put on the stack we generally have to put on the heap too because we memoize it. Maintaining the stack and the heap with the same data is theoretically less efficient.\\\"\\n\\n### Key Benefits Achieved\\n1. **Interruptible**: Can pause at any fiber node\\n2. **Resumable**: Can continue from where we left off\\n3. **Prioritizable**: Different work can have different priorities\\n4. **Memoizable**: Can skip unchanged subtrees\\n5. **Abortable**: Can throw away work-in-progress if higher priority work arrives\\n\\n### Related Links\\n- Issue #6170 \\\"New Core Algorithm\\\": https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6170\\n- Issue #7925 \\\"Fiber Umbrella\\\": https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7925\\n- Andrew Clark's Fiber Architecture doc: https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture\"}"

I use a fiber for that. That's nice because it allow us to nest them inside the tree for things like portals. It also allows me to reuse the child reconciliation for the top level.\\n>\\n> The current thing won't quite work because there needs to be two fibers even at the top level. Work in progress. I might just to another mutable top level node that's not a fiber.\\n>\\n> It also has a priority feature which searches the **current** tree (not the work in progress since that no long exists after a flush) for the highest priority work to do next. This is a key component of this architecture. The priority flag represents the highest priority in the subtree.\\n>\\n> Pending state updates will have priority associated with themselves on the fiber itself.\\n>\\n> There is currently no priority associated with the pending props themselves which means that they get the same priority as anything deep in the tree. Pending props is kind of an edge case. I think that the only time that happens is if you have a high priority update which leads to update a lower priority tree so that the update in that tree gets deprioritized. But I'm not completely sure how this will work yet. Maybe they should only ever exists on the 'work in progress' nodes.\\n>\\n> When a new change comes in we reset and rescan the tree. That change could've been a higher priority or higher/earlier in the tree than what we're currently working on. We can probably avoid this reset+rescan for new changes which has lower priority.\\n>\\n> Currently this reset throws out the work already done to the tree, so we'll need to start look at the 'alternate' tree to see if there was already any work done there that we can reuse. We can use pending props for that.\\\"\\n\\n### Key Concepts Introduced\\n1. **Host Container Fiber**: Top-level fiber for the root container\\n2. **Priority System**: Priority flags to schedule different types of work\\n3. **Work-in-Progress / Current tree duality**: The \\\"alternate\\\" tree pattern\\n4. **Priority scanning**: Finding highest priority work in subtree\\n\\n### Significance\\nThis PR introduced the **priority scheduling** concept that would later evolve into:\\n- React 16's basic scheduling\\n- React 18's lanes system\\n- The foundation for Concurrent Mode\"}"

React 16 Beta 1 ships with the new algorithm.\\n> https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10294\\n> This is not the end but a beginning of a new chapter for React.\\n> The basics of all these things are now in place (even though some are not exposed yet), and I'm excited to see how they will evolve over time.\\\"\\n\\n### What React 16 Shipped With (from Issue #10294)\\n\\n> \\\"React 16 is the first release that ships with a rewrite of the React core (previously codenamed \\\"Fiber\\\"). This rewrite had a few goals:\\n>\\n> - Remove old internal abstractions that didn't age well and hindered internal changes.\\n> - Let us ship some of the most requested features like returning arrays from render, recovering from component errors, and readable component stack traces for every error.\\n> - Enable us to start experimenting with asynchronous rendering of components for better perceived performance.\\n>\\n> **This initial React 16.0 release is mostly focused on compatibility with existing apps. It does not enable asynchronous rendering yet.** We will introduce an opt-in to the async mode later during React 16.x.\\\"\\n\\n### Breaking Changes in React 16.0\\n\\n**Error Handling:**\\n> \\\"Previously, runtime errors used to put React into a broken state and produce cryptic errors. React 16 fixes this by introducing a special kind of components called 'error boundaries'. Error boundaries can catch runtime errors in a component tree, log them, and display a fallback UI instead.\\\"\\n\\n> \\\"If there is an uncaught error in a component, and there is no error boundary up in the tree, **the whole component tree will be unmounted**.\\\"\\n\\n**Lifecycle Changes:**\\n> \\\"When replacing `<A />` with `<B />`, `B.componentWillMount` now always happens before `A.componentWillUnmount`. Previously, `A.componentWillUnmount` could fire first in some cases.\\\"\\n\\n**Packaging:**\\n> \\\"There is no `react/lib/*` and `react-dom/lib/*` anymore. Even in CommonJS environments, React and ReactDOM are precompiled to single files ('flat bundles').\\\"\\n\\n### New Features Enabled by Fiber\\n\\n1. **Error Boundaries** (`componentDidCatch`)\\n2. **Return arrays from render** (Fragments)\\n3. **Return strings from render**\\n4. **Portals** (`ReactDOM.createPortal()`)\\n5. **Streaming server rendering** (`ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream()`)\\n6. **Custom DOM attributes** (pass through unknown attributes)\\n\\n### Timeline from Fiber Start to Release\\n- March 2, 2016: Issue #6170 opened\\n- May 3, 2016: First Fiber PR merged (#6690)\\n- July 26, 2017: React 16 Beta 1\\n- September 26, 2017: React 16.0.0 stable\\n\\n**Total development time: ~18 months**\\n\\n### What Was NOT Shipped Yet\\nAsync rendering was not enabled in 16.0 - this would come later:\\n- React 16.3: `getDerivedStateFromProps`, new context API\\n- React 16.6: `React.lazy`, `Suspense` (code splitting only)\\n- React 18: Full concurrent features\\n\\n### Related Links\\n- Blog post: https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html\\n- Error handling blog: https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html\"}"

This means if there are two pending transitions at the same time, neither transition can finish until both can finish, even if they affect completely separate parts of the UI.\\n\\nThe new approach is to assign a different lane to each consecutive transition, by shifting the bit to the right each time. When we reach the end of the bit range, we cycle back to the first bit. In practice, this should mean that all transitions get their own dedicated lane, unless we have more pending transitions than lanes, which should be rare.\\n\\nWe retain our existing behavior of assigning the same lane to all transitions within the same event. This is achieved by caching the first lane assigned to a transition, then re-using that one until the next React task, by which point the event must have finished. This preserves the guarantee that all transition updates that result from a single event will be consistent.\\\"\\n\\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\\n1. Before this: Two transitions blocked each other even if unrelated\\n2. After this: Independent transitions can complete separately\\n3. Uses bit-shifting through transition lane range\\n4. Maintains consistency WITHIN an event (same lane)\\n5. Allows concurrency BETWEEN events (different lanes)\\n\\nRECONCILER IMPACT:\\n- Changed lane assignment from static to dynamic for transitions\\n- Uses bit-shifting to cycle through available transition lanes\\n- Enables true concurrent UI updates\\n- Major improvement to React 18's concurrent rendering UX\"}"

This means that there are certain cases that can appear confusing such as a node being added/removed when it really would've appeared later in the list.\\n\\nI also present abstract components in the stack, these are presented with the client props and no diff since we don't have the props that were on the server. The lack of difference might be confusing but it's useful for context.\\\"\\n\\nWHY: Hydration mismatches were notoriously hard to debug - you'd get a generic error with no indication of what differed. This PR adds actual diffs showing the server vs client content, making hydration debugging dramatically easier. Combined with component stacks, you can now trace exactly where mismatches occur.\"}"
